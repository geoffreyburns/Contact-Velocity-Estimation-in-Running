# Contact-Velocity-Estimation-in-Running
A method to estimate the contact and flight velocities of a runner using only temporal measures (i.e., contact time and flight time). Simple MatLab and R functions are provided to implement the equation solver.

vc.est estimates the stance velocity
Fh.est estimates the horizontal force
